# <bindingName> Ring

This is an experimental binding to the Ring.com API. It currently supports a Ring account
and is able to discover Ring Video Doorbells and Chimes. They need to be registered in
the Ring account before they will be detected.

It currently does *not* support live video streaming, but you can view recorded video's,
if this service is enabled in the Ring account.

## Supported Things

The binding currently supports Ring Video Doorbell and Chimes.

## Discovery

Auto-discovery is applicable to this binding. After (manually) adding a Ring Account thing, 
registered doorbells and chimes will be auto discovered.

## Binding Configuration

There is binding configuration necessary. The easiest way to do this is from the Paper UI. Just
add a new thing, select the Ring binding, and enter username and password.
